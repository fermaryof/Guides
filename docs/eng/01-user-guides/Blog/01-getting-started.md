This community focuses on presenting a game that offers entertainment, fun, and a sustainable and community-oriented economy, where players can enjoy a diverse experience and earn rewards without affecting the game's economy.

This is a free project that promotes active participation and long-term growth.

## What is Space Hunters?

**Space Hunters (SH)** is an imaginary strategy game for the gaming community, whether they are interested in the *cryptographic world* or not.

SH uses various economic styles and game modes, giving users the ability to choose how to play and create their own strategies based on the wide variety of possibilities, such as:
* Engaging people to play together by exploring, extracting resources, and important elements needed for crafting.
* Basic, secret, and time-limited missions.
* Daily game tasks, rewards, and achievements that complement scalability.
* Community-guided Free-To-Play modes and social activity.
* A social token that constantly rewards player interaction and community engagement.
* Resources (materials) to create, build, and repair assets and structures.

> And many other ways. Stay tuned!

## What is the current state of the project?

**Space Hunters** is still in development, but you can be part of our progress and start acquiring free NFTs and tokens by participating and being active in our communities. Our economic-social system always strategically rewards all members; don't miss out on the opportunity.

## Is there anything I can participate in right now?

As part of our community, you can follow us on social media, interact with other members, and share game links and updates. Our algorithm will constantly reward you with $HCREDIT tokens. You can participate in the free NFT whitelists we offer every month, as well as other limited-time activities or events. Follow us on our announcement channel so you don’t miss any opportunities.

## What is $HCREDIT and how can it be obtained?

$HCREDIT is a social economy token within **SH** that you can earn by participating in project activities and with your friends. The economic system it uses is surprisingly effective, constantly rewarding the community through various activities.

Currently, you can obtain $HCREDIT in the following ways:
  * Doing daily Check-ins on our [Telegram BOT](https://t.me/SpaceHuntersBot?start=NK1Y6ST3).
  * Completing tasks on [Zealy](https://zealy.io/cw/spacehuntersthereborn/invite/UroI4c6fhtB3SX65siHBX).
  * Using our 2-level referral system.
  * Adding **SpaceHunters** to your name on Telegram.
  * Chatting in our groups or in Guilds associated with the project.

> Every time a friend registers for the project using your referral link, you earn *100 $HCREDIT*. You receive *4 $HCREDIT* if your friends do daily Check-ins, and *1 $HCREDIT* if your friends refer other friends who also do daily Check-ins.

> If you add SpaceHunter, Space Hunrter, SpaceHunters, or Space Hunters to your name on Telegram, our algorithm will detect it and reward you daily with $HCREDIT tokens directly to your account. The more consecutive days you keep it, the more the reward increases, up to 28 days for a total of 2500 $HCREDIT, after which it starts over again.

**Example:**

## Purposes and Uses of $HCREDIT

Here you’ll find an easy way to understand the purposes and uses of $HCREDIT in one of the game modes (free-to-play).

Imagine a land where you need workers, but this land can only be bought with $HCREDIT, and your workers can only participate in powering up the land with $HCREDIT. Every hour, landowners and workers earn rewards in **$HCASH** (the main game token) for their participation.

Now, this game mode is FREE, providing active players and their followers with $HCREDIT tokens just for participating and supporting the project in social tasks, check-ins, etc. This means that the more active you are, the more opportunities you'll have.

The "Generator" package will be limited and expensive in $HCREDIT tokens and will only be available in that currency. This is because it is a game mode focused on social support and community engagement within Space Hunters and our partner communities. For example, if you support one of our partners in a stream they’re doing, you could earn $HCREDIT tokens, or by being active in their groups, etc. But that’s not all—there’s more to come. $HCREDIT will become widespread and reach all communities with many formats and utilities. But back to the topic of "Generators": every hour, you’ll receive 35% of the tokens your Generator has accumulated, and 65% will be distributed among all contributors who don’t own Generators but help power yours.

The "Engineers" cost 100 $HCREDIT and expire in 24 hours. You can deploy as many as your $HCREDIT allows and generate the main game token $HCASH every hour.
To keep generating without stopping, you need to develop a strategy that allows you to generate $HCREDIT every day, considering all the avenues we provide.

Right now, we’re in the development stage, so it’s the best time for you to accumulate as many tokens as possible.

The mechanics involving **$HCREDIT** have been carefully analyzed to ensure that players can benefit in the long term and that the game’s economy remains sustainable without being affected by inflation.

You can get more details in the [technical document](https://spaceheroes.gitbook.io/space-hunters), but to summarize, keep this in mind: The contribution to generator owners is called “Engineer Contract,” which expires after 24 hours to encourage daily community participation. This means that if a user doesn’t stay active, they won’t earn $HCREDIT, which in turn means they won’t get more $HCASH, and as fewer players are involved in Generation, there will be more $HCASH to divide.
The economy is backed by the algorithm, utilities, and acquisition formats focused on players.

> Something similar happens with **$HCREDIT**: the more you get, the more chances you have to acquire **$HCASH**. We support content creators, gamers, and community members.

As a generator owner, you can upgrade its capacity to increase the number of engineers (slot capacity) that can work on it, as more engineers mean more power. And this is only possible with **$HCREDIT**.

**In summary:** $HCREDIT is 50% of the deflationary system for $HCASH, while $HCASH has its own allocation and economic system that rewards users for playing and staying active.
Focus on winning; we’ll take care of the rest!

> The main difference between **$HCREDIT** and **$CASH** is that one is within the game, and the other is the end goal: to receive payment in tokens that allow you to monetize the time and effort invested, known as **Play-To-Earn**.

## Game Items

90% of the items are free and can be obtained by playing or purchasing them with tokens. Additionally, each item has its own probability and allocation calculations, ensuring that the circulating amounts and demand for the item are aligned with its importance to the user and its use within the game.

## How Can I Start "Farming" $HCREDIT?

1. To start, first ask a friend for their referral link or contact any member of our community to get theirs. You need a "sponsor"; you must be invited to activate your account on our BOT.
> If you got here on your own, you can use our [referral link](https://t.me/SpaceHuntersBot?start=NK1Y6ST3), which we do not benefit from and is only meant to help new users start this adventure.  
2. Then make sure to click "DONE," and you'll be able to start using the BOT commands.
3. Use the /start command to initiate the BOT or to see your own referral link and invite other friends.

4. Use the /username command to register your username as you want to be called in the game later. Example: /username YankielDBC.
5. To start your daily check-in, press the 📇Check-in button, which will earn you 20 $HCREDIT.
6. To view your current $HCREDIT balance, use the 📇Check-in button again.

## How Can I Obtain Free NFTs?

Space Hunters will launch NFTs on various Blockchains, but we are initially starting with the WAX Blockchain due to its free transactions and gamer-focused ecosystem.

The first step is to set up your crypto wallet.

> Make sure your wallet is compatible with the WAX Blockchain. There are several options, including WaxCloud Wallet, Anchor, and Wombat.

> If you are in Latin America or encounter restrictions due to your region, try using Wombat.

### Wallets

* [Wax Cloud Wallet](https://www.mycloudwallet.com/)
* [Wombat](https://www.wombat.app/)

After obtaining a wallet, just stay tuned to the [Announcements Channel](https://t.me/spacehuntersnews) to participate in activities where you can claim your free NFTs and use them to play **Space Hunters** after its launch.
